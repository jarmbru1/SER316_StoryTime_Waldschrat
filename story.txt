There I was, hanging upside down by my ankles in the middle of Marienplatz wearing nothing but my Lederhose.
"Ach, du lieber, not again!" I shouted as I tried to remember the previous Nacht.
Looking around I saw an extra large Dirndl on the ground next to me.
I looked to the left of the dirndl, saw a raketenrucksack, and flew off.
I also noticed RyeBrot crumbs still clinging to my beard.
I landed at the nearest Flughafen, hoping the crumbs didn't qualify as FOD on the airfield.
As I walked into the Flughafen, I pulled a Bratwurst out of my pocket and started munching.
However that was not satisfying my hunger. I need a doner! So I rent out a Audi station wagon and head out to Berlin.
